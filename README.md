# FLIC
This is the repository of the MATLAB script for analyzing data from FLIC system (Fly Liquid-Food Interaction Counter).   
The FLIC system is used to quantify the number and duration of contacts between a fly and food.
It describe the feeding behavior of fruit flies at higher resolution, compared to traditional methods such as CAFE assay.

The script includes comments explaning how the analysis works. It is written by referring to the following paper.
